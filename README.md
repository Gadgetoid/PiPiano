# PiPiano
## Welcome to the PiPiano documentation.
Here you will find instructions on how to assemble your PiPiano and then program it using both Python and C.

### Assembly guide
Please visit [this page](blob/master/assembling.md) to see an assembly guide.
This guide teaches you not only how to solder but how to put together your PiPiano kit.

### Example code
In order to use the examples, you will need to use 'git' on your Pi to download the code.
This is a simple procedure. First of all, open up a command line terminal and type in the following:

```

cd ~

git clone https://github.com/ZacharyIgielman/PiPiano

```
